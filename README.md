A simple pixel art RPG game developed with C# and the MonoGame framework for my high school project. I also created all the pixel art myself using the program Aseprite. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the source code, but the final result is uploaded on YouTube: https://youtu.be/Zj1NwIlJ70c
